### **Description of the Project**  
The **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI** is a web-based interface designed to simplify the management of user roles and permissions within an organization. It supports key administrative tasks such as:  
- Adding new roles with descriptions and permissions.  
- Editing or deleting existing roles.  
- Displaying dynamic statistics on the dashboard, such as the total number of roles and active roles.  

The project emphasizes an intuitive user experience with a responsive design, styled-components for consistent theming, and mock API integration for role and user management.

### **My Role in Implementing the RBAC UI**  
As the primary developer of this project, I:  
1. Designed and implemented the **Add Role** and **Edit Role** functionalities, including form validation.  
2. Built the **Roles Table** to display and manage roles efficiently.  
3. Created the **Dashboard** to display real-time statistics about users and roles.  
4. Used **React.js** and **Styled-components** to build a modern and interactive UI.  
5. Integrated **mock API** calls to simulate backend interactions.  
6. Ensured cross-browser compatibility and a responsive design for seamless user experience.
